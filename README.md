python-x32
==========

This fork is using the library as proxy for X32. Proxy request changes from mixer (ip given from command line) and forwards them to N target-hosts (defined at the code). Each target have regex-filter to limit packets sent. For example using arduino ethernet as button panel, it might be good idea to filter fader values out.

Second reason to use proxy is limit of 4 clients to one mixer. Using button-panels or/and touchOSC ipad-clients (http://hexler.net/software/touchosc), it is easy to have lot more clients.

==========

Python library to interact with Behringer X32 digital mixing desk using OSC-messages (open sound control).

The Behringer X32 has quite good documentation of OSC-messages, but not all messages are documented. Messages that control what 
page the user has selected on the desk are not documented.

See http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/X32.aspx

Using dumpmessages.py is quite easy to find some undocumented OSC-messages. 
Messages can also be captured by Wireshark and XControl, but using dumpmessages.py is easier.

Undocumented messages
---------------------

This is just a listing of some undocumented messages. Most undocumented messages start with /-

/xremote

Used by the Behringer Windows-application XRemote to instruct the Behringer X32 to send all state changes to allow
XRemote to follow all user selections.

-stat prefix is used to signal gui-things, like what fader layer is selected or the screen visible

OSCMessage("/-stat/chfaderbank", [0]): What main channel fader bank is selected
 - 0: CH 1-16
 - 1: CH 17-32
 - 2: Aux in /USB / FX returns
 - 3: Bus masters
 
 OSCMessage("/-stat/grpfaderbank", [0]): Group channel bank selected
  - 0: DCA 1-8
  - 1: BUS 1-8
  - 2: BUS 9-16
  - 3: Matrix 1-6, Main C
  
OSCMessage("/-stat/selidx", [0]): Select channel index
 - 0-31 Ch 1-32
 - 32-63 Ch 33-64
 - 64-47: Aux in /USB
 - 48-63: Bus master
 - 64-69: Matrix 1-6
 - 70: L/R
 - 71: Mono/Center

OSCMessage("/-stat/solosw/01", [0]): 0/1 Is on/off of soloswitch
 - 01: Same id as used for selidx, but +1
 
OSCMessage("/-show/show/A/003/name", ['AAAAA']): Name of a show

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/screen", [0]): Set active screen, eg. Home, Meters, Routing, Setup, Library

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/screen", [6]): Monitor page (Monitor, talkback A, B and Osc)

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/screen", [8]): Scene configuration screen

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/screen", [9]): User bank configuration screen

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/CHAN/page", [0]): Select channel page in "Home"-screen

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/METER/page", [0]): Select meter page

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/ROUTE/page", [1]): Routing page

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/SETUP/page", [1])

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/LIB/page", [0])

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/FX/page", [1])

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/mutegrp", [0]):
 - 0: Turn off mutegrp screen
 - 1: Turn on mutegrp screen

OSCMessage("/-stat/screen/utils", [0]): 
 - 0: Turn off utils screen
 - 1: Turn on utils screen

OSCMessage("/-stat/userbank", [0]):
 - 0: User bank A
 - 1: User bank B
 - 2: User bank C
